Movie App Tutorial
======

# General Introduction

This tutorial walks through the creation of a complete web application, [Neo4j Movies](http://neo4jmovies.herokuapp.com/#/movies), a Neo4j-Swagger-AngularJS version of Cineasts.net, a social movie database where users can connect with friends, rate movies, share scores, and generate recommendations for new friends and movies.

This tutorial takes the reader through the steps necessary to create the application, explaining each step of the stack on the way. The complete source code for the app is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kbastani/neo4j-movies-template).

# The Stack: An Overview

## Neo4j

Written in Java since YEAR, [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/)is a scalable, a fully transactional database (ACID) that stores data structured as graphs. Designed to be intuitive, high performance and scalable, it has a disk-based, native storage manager optimized for storing graph structures with maximum performance and scalability. Neo4j can handle graphs with many billions of nodes/relationships/properties on a single machine, but can also be scaled out across multiple machines for high availability.

## Swagger

Developed by Wordnik, Swagger™ defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

## AngularJS

_What HTML should have been_, AngularJS is an open-source web application framework, assists in the creation of web applications that only require HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client side. Its goal is to augment web applications with model–view–controller (MVC) capability, in an effort to make both development and testing easier. AngularJS' two-way data binding is its most notable feature and reduces the amount of code written by relieving the server backend of templating responsibilities. Instead, templates are rendered in plain HTML according to data contained in a scope defined in the model.

# The Domain Model

The Neo4j data model consists of nodes and relationships, both of which can have key/value-style properties. What does that mean, exactly? Nodes are the graph database name for records, with property keys instead of column names. That's normal enough. Relationships are the special part. In Neo4j, relationships are first-class citizens. More than a simple foreign-key reference to another record, relationships carry information. So we can link together nodes into semantically rich networks.

# Neo4j: Setting up the Database

## Neo4j: Getting it Running

- If you haven't done so already, download Neo4jhere
- Extract Neo4j to a convenient location and rename the folder to something less cumbersome, like 'Neo4j', if you want
- Navigate to the extracted folder and run./bin/neo4j start
- If all goes well, you should see the Neo4j web application running athttp://localhost:7474/

To try out Neo4j on your local machine, an empty database is not much fun.

- Navigate to your Neo4j directory
- If you have Neo4j running, stop it with./bin/neo4j stopin the Neo4j directory
- If you want to make sure you killed it good, check by runninglaunchctl list | grep neoandlaunchctl removeany processes that might be listed
- If youls data, you'll see a file calledgraph.db.
- Delete the existinggraph.db.
- Grab the zipped movies graph database file from thedatabasesfolder in the web app repository
- Unzip it into thedatafolder
- Run Neo4j! You should be able to see some nodes athttp://localhost:7474/

## Cypher: An Introduction 

Get started with Cypher on the Neo4j [Learn Cypher](http://www.neo4j.org/learn/cypher) page.

Don't know how much to put in this section.

## Building the Database

Although the tutorial reposoitory comes with a pre-built graph.db file, you'll need to be able to create your own graph.db file with your own data. This section will demonstrate how to re-create the existing graph.db file on your local Neo4j instance. Although there are multiple ways to create a graph.db from scratch, this tutorial will use the Cypher command LOAD CSV. 

### Pre-requisities

- Stop Neo4j and move the existing `graph.db` file out of the `data` folder in your instance of Neo4j. When you restart Neo4j, it will detect the absence of this file and generate a blank one. 
- Prepare and organize your data into CSV files. 
	- Each node should have a unique ID
	- Each node type should have its own file. In this example, there are three node types, Genre, Person and Movie, and their data are in `genre_nodes.csv`, `person_nodes.csv` and `movie_nodes.csv`, respectively. 
	- Each relationship type should have its own file. In this example, there are seven relationship types, each represented in their own `.csv` file
	- Delimiters should not appear in the raw data. Unlike the comma or any other commonly-used punctiation mark, the pipe `|` is a decent choice for delimiter as it is unlikely to appear in the raw data, and a quick search reveals it does not appear in the data. 
	- Headers should be unique within files. As LOAD CSV (in this example) uses headers, make sure that each column in a file has a unique header. 
	

### Using LOAD CSV

# Swagger: Querying the Database

## Node-Neo4j-Swagger API: An Introduction

The Node-Neo4j-Swagger API was written to make it as easy as possible to create an API using Node.js and Neo4j that can be consumed by some other app. Swagger provides interactive documentation so that it is easy to interact with the API. The goal is merge Swagger with Neo4j queries and visualizations so developers can see how Neo4j and the API results relate to each other.
