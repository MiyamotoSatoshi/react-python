= Users in the Node / React Neo4j Movies Template
:img: ./img

== Introduction

The https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-movies-template[Neo4j Movie App Template] provides an easy-to-use foundation for your next Neo4j project or experiment.
This article will walk through the creation of users that can log in and interact with the app’s data.
In the https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-movies-template[Neo4j Movie App Template] example, these users will be able to log in and out, rate movies, and receive movie recommendations.

== The User Model

Aside from creating themselves and authenticating with the app, `Users` (blue) can rate `Movies` (yellow) with the `:RATED` relationship, illustrated below. 

image::{img}/image02_user_graph.png[]

=== `User` Properties

`password`: The hashed version of the user’s chosen password
`api_key`: The user’s API key, which the user uses to authenticate requests
`id`: The user’s unique ID 
`username`: The user’s chosen username

=== `:RATED` Properties 

`rating`: an integer rating between `1` and `5`, with `5` being _love it_ and `1` being _hate it_.

image::{img}/image04_my_rated_movie.png[]

== Users can create accounts

Before a `User` can rate a `Movie`, the the user has to exist - someone has to sign up for an account.
Signup will create a node in the database with a `User` label along with properties necessary for logging in and maintaining a session. 

.web/src/pages/Signup.jsx
image::{img}/image03_create_account.png[]

The registration endpoint is located at `/api/v0/register`.
The app submits a request to the register endpoint when a user fills out the "Create an Account" form and taps "Create Account".

Assuming you have the API running, you can test requests either by using the interactive docs at `3000/docs/`, or by using cURL.

=== Use Case: Create New User

==== Request

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{ "username": "Mary Jane", "password": "SuperPassword"}' 'http://localhost:3000/api/v0/register'
----

==== Response

[source,json]
----
{  
   "id":"e1e157a2-1fb5-416a-b819-eb75c480dfc6",
   "username":"Mary333 Jane",
   "avatar":{  
      "full_size":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b2a02b21db2222c472fc23ff78804687?d=retro"
   }
}
----

=== Use Case: Try to Create New User but Username is Already Taken

==== Request

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{ "username": "Mary Jane", "password": "SuperPassword"}' 'http://localhost:3000/api/v0/register'
----

==== Response

[source,json]
----
{  
   "username":"username already in use"
}
----

User registration logic is implemented in `/api/models/users.js`:

[source,javascript]
----
var register = function(session, username, password) {
    return session.run('MATCH (user:User {username: {username}}) RETURN user', {
            username: username
        })
        .then(results => {
            if (!_.isEmpty(results.records)) {
                throw {
                    username: 'username already in use',
                    status: 400
                }
            }
            else {
                return session.run('CREATE (user:User {id: {id}, username: {username}, password: {password}, api_key: {api_key}}) RETURN user', {
                    id: uuid.v4(),
                    username: username,
                    password: hashPassword(username, password),
                    api_key: randomstring.generate({
                        length: 20,
                        charset: 'hex'
                    })
                }).then(results => {
                    return new User(results.records[0].get('user'));
                })
            }
        });
};
----

== Users can log in

Now that users are able to register for an account, we can define the view that allows them to login to the site and start a session. 

./web/src/pages/Login.jsx
image::{img}/image07_login.png[]

The registration endpoint is located at `/api/v0/login`.
The app submits a request to the login  endpoint when a user fills a username and password and taps "Create Account".

Assuming you have the API running, you can test requests either by using the interactive docs at `3000/docs/`, or by using cURL.

=== Use Case: Login

==== Request

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{"username": "Mary Jane", "password": "SuperPassword"}' 'http://localhost:3000/api/v0/login'
----

==== Response

[source,json]
----
{  
	"token":"5a85862fb28a316ea6a1"
}
----

=== Use Case: Wrong Password

==== Request

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{ "username": "Mary Jane", "password": "SuperPassword"}' 'http://localhost:3000/api/v0/register'
----

==== Response

[source,json]
----
{  
   "username":"username already in use"
}

You can take a look at the implementation in `/api/models/users.js`:

----
var me = function(session, apiKey) {
    return session.run('MATCH (user:User {api_key: {api_key}}) RETURN user', {
            api_key: apiKey
        })
        .then(results => {
            if (_.isEmpty(results.records)) {
                throw {
                    message: 'invalid authorization key',
                    status: 401
                };
            }
            return new User(results.records[0].get('user'));
        });
};
var login = function(session, username, password) {
    return session.run('MATCH (user:User {username: {username}}) RETURN user', {
            username: username
        })
        .then(results => {
            if (_.isEmpty(results.records)) {
                throw {
                    username: 'username does not exist',
                    status: 400
                }
            }
            else {
                var dbUser = _.get(results.records[0].get('user'), 'properties');
                if (dbUser.password != hashPassword(username, password)) {
                    throw {
                        password: 'wrong password',
                        status: 400
                    }
                }
                return {
                    token: _.get(dbUser, 'api_key')
                };
            }
        });
};
----

The code here should look similar to `/register`.
There is a similar form to fill out, where a user types in their `username` and `password`.

With the given username, a `User` is initialized.
The password they filled out in the form is verified against the hashed password that was retrieved from the corresponding `:User` node in the database. 

If the verification is successful it will return a token.
The user is then directed to an authentication page, from which they can navigate through the app, view their user profile, and rate movies.
Below is a rather empty user profile for a freshly created user:

//TODO image
./web/src/pages/Profile.jsx
image::{img}/image00_empty_profile.png[]

== Users can rate movies

Once a user has logged in and navigated to a page that displays movies, the user can select a star rating for the movie or remove the rating of a movie he or she has already rated. 

image::{img}/image03_my_rated_movie.png[]

The user should be able to access their previous ratings (and the movies that were rated) both on their user profile and the movie detail page in question.

== User can be recommended movies based on their recommendations

When a user visits their own profile, the user will see movie recommendations.
There are many ways to build recommendations, and you might want to use one or a combination of the methods below to build the appropriate recommendation system for your particular use case.
In the movie template, you can find the recommendation endpoint at `movies/recommended`.

=== User-Centric, User-Based Recommendations

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (me:User {username:'Sherman'})-[my:RATED]->(m:Movie)
MATCH (other:User)-[their:RATED]->(m)
WHERE me <> other
AND abs(my.rating - their.rating) < 2
WITH other,m
MATCH (other)-[otherRating:RATED]->(movie:Movie)
WHERE movie <> m
WITH avg(otherRating.rating) AS avgRating, movie
RETURN movie
ORDER BY avgRating desc
LIMIT 25
----

=== Movie-Centric, Keyword-Based Recommendations

Newer movies will have few or no ratings, so they will never be recommended to users if the application uses user-rating based recommendations.
Since movies have keywords, the application can recommend movies with similar keywords for a particular movie.
This case is useful when the user has made few or no ratings.
For example, site visitors interested in movies like `Elysium` will likely be interested in movies with similar keywords as `Elysium`.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title:'Elysium'})
MATCH (m)-[:HAS_KEYWORD]->(k:Keyword)
MATCH (movie:Movie)-[r:HAS_KEYWORD]->(k)
WHERE m <> movie
WITH movie, count(DISTINCT r) AS commonKeywords
RETURN movie
ORDER BY commonKeywords DESC
LIMIT 25
----

==== User-Centric, Keyword-Based Recommendations

Users with established tastes may be interested in finding movies with similar characteristics as his or her highly-rated movies, while not necessarily caring about whether another user has or hasn’t already rated the movie. For example, `Sherman` has seen many movies, and is looking for new movies similar to the ones he has already watched. 

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User {username:'Sherman'})-[:RATED]->(m:Movie)
MATCH (m)-[:HAS_KEYWORD]->(k:Keyword)
MATCH (movie:Movie)-[r:HAS_KEYWORD]->(k)
WHERE m <> movie
WITH movie, count(DISTINCT r) AS commonKeywords
RETURN movie
ORDER BY commonKeywords DESC
LIMIT 25
